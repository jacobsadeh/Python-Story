# Python-Story

Hey! Welcome to my game. You need to download all of the files and put them into the same folder for this to work 
(might also have to change a bit of the code to fit the music)

I own none of the sprites or the music, and I am making nothing off of this.

Credit for sprites goes to Deviant Art and Maplestory.Design

Music was found off Youtube.

Thanks!
